# Main GNUmakefile for VX32 source tree.
#
# To make it more convenient to change the makefile system
# without having to re-autoconf all the time,
# ALL configure script substitutions for the whole build system
# are concentrated in this file alone.
# This file simply establishes the appropriate substituted symbol names
# and then includes the top-level makefile fragment, './Makefrag'.
