Standard C library for the VX codelet environment.
Provides many standard C and a few UNIX functions,
but makes no attempt at providing much "legacy"
UNIX-like API functionality.
VX codelets must know they are codelets,
or else rely on a fancier compatibility layer.

Many of these C library routines are from FreeBSD 5.3.
