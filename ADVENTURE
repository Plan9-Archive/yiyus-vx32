Welcome to vx32.

> look

You are near the bottom of a tree.

> look doc

You see PDFs of the two published papers about vx32.

> look src

You see the source code behind the papers.

> examine src

Upon closer examination, the src/ directory contains the following
subdirectories:

	libvx32/	the vx32 virtual machine itself

	vxrun/	a simple portable execution environment
	libvxc/	an optional C library for use in vxrun apps
	
	vxlinux/	a simple delegation-based system jail for Linux

	hash/	hash function benchmarks (Alpaca results in vx32 paper)
	micro/	micro benchmarks (in vx32 paper)
	vxa/		compression benchmarks (VXA results in vx32 paper)
	
	9vx/		Plan 9 VX

> build src

Okay: cd src; make.
On BSD machines you may need to say gmake instead.

> install src

Okay: cd src; make; make install

> more

If you want to try the benchmarks on your own machines,
you can run "run.sh" in any of the benchmark directories
and then inspect results.txt

> show license

The individual subdirectories contain LICENSE files explaining
the copyrights and licenses.  

The vx32 core, found in src/libvx32/, is licensed under the LGPL v2.1;
see src/libvx32/LICENSE for details.

The sample programs, found in src/vxrun/ and src/vxlinux/, are made
available under the traditional MIT license to encourage use as jumping-off
points for new programs.  See src/vxrun/LICENSE and src/vxlinux/LICENSE.

The C library, which is found in src/libvxc and is absolutely not required
in order to use vx32, is mostly taken from FreeBSD and Sun Microsystems
code, both of which use BSD-like licenses.  See the copyright notices in the
individual files.  Files without copyright notices were written by us and
are licensed under an MIT license.

The benchmarks in hash/ and vxa/ are mostly code written by others.
See the copyright notices in individual files.  The benchmarks in micro/
are too short to worry about.

The Plan 9 VX user-level operating system, found in src/9vx/, is
derived from Plan 9 from Bell Labs and is made available under the
terms of the Lucent Public License.  See src/9vx/LICENSE.

> get vx32-gcc

You probably don't need to do that.

> get vx32-gcc

Okay, if you insist.  You can download vx32-specific versions
of binutils and gcc from http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/vm/
and then extract them in this directory.  Then you can run

	cd binutils-2.18-vx32
	./configure --target=vx32
	make
	make install
	
	cd gcc-4.1.2-vx32
	./configure --enable-languages=c --disable-libssp --target=vx32
	make
	make install
	make distclean

But again, you probably don't need to do that.
If you are on a 32-bit ELF machine, your host gcc is likely fine.
