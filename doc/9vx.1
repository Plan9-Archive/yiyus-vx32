.SH DESCRIPTION
Plan 9 VX (or 9vx for short) is a port of the Plan 9 operating system to
run on top of commodity operating systems, allowing the use of both Plan
9 and the host system simultaneously. To run user programs, 9vx creates
an appropriate address space in a window within its own address space
and invokes vx32 to simulate user mode execution.
.PP
9vx configuration is determined by assignments of the form
.I var=value
read from its argument list or from one or more
files specified as 
.I â€“f inifile
(a file name
.L -
means the standard input). The rules are the same than for plan9.ini(8)
files, with the addition that values between quotes in rc(1) style
can span multiple lines.
.PP
The following variables are understood by 9vx:
.PD
.TP
.B cpulimit
Maximum cpu usage in percentage. A value of 0 (default) means that
there is no limit
.TP
.B memsize
Memory size in Mb (256 by default)
.TP
.B canopenpath
The host files whose path begins with
.I canopenpath
can be opened from
.I #Z
(
.I /
by default)
.TP
.B etherx
Setup a virtual ethernet device. Parameters take the default values
.I type=tap
(it can also be
.I pcap
),
.I dev=/dev/tap0
for tap and
.I dev=
for pcap (will look for the first one available) and
,I addr=00:00:09:00:00:0x
in both cases. If no device is configured the
network stack of the host system is used
.TP
.B initarg
Set
.I init=/386/init -t initarg
quoting initarg as needed
.TP
.B localroot
Set
.I nobootprompt=local!#Z/localroot
after converting localroot to an absolute path in the host.
.TP
.B user
Set user name, the host system user is used by default
.PP
Additional
.I var=value
pairs are used to set environment variables before control is passed to
boot(8). Some configuration values can be set directly using flags in
the command line:
.I -i
sets
.I initargs
,
.I -r
sets
.I localroot
and
.I -u
sets
.I user.
If
.I -t
is given the current tty or the standard input/output will be used as
the system console. With
.I -g
the gui will not be started.
.SS Booting 9vx
When started, 9vx will run a modified version of boot(8) which accepts
additional root locations for the local boot method: local
directories, iso images and bz2 files (a compressed file system /boot/rootfs.bz2 is
included in the 9vx executable). Fossil and kfs partitions (possibly in a local file) can be used too, as well as the tcp boot method.
.SS Running 9vx
Some scripts are included with 9vx as example:
.I 9vxc
boots a cpu sever and
.I 9vxp
boots a terminal as if
.I profile
was the lib/profile file.
.I 9vxtap
shows how to use the tap device.
.I acmevx
uses 9vxp to run acme(1) inside 9vx.
.I rcvx
directly runs rc(1) from the included rootfs.bz2 image.
.SS Exiting 9vx
Reboot signals terminate 9vx execution. In particular, the reboot command
will exit printing its arguments to starndard error.
.SH BUGS
The pcap ethernet device is not compiled by default (fails without
pcap.h). To compile it, set PLAN9PCAP to etherpcap in the Makefrag file
and recompile.
.P
The menu system of plan9.ini(8) is not supported in
.I 9vx.ini
files.
.P
Debugging flags are not documented (
.I -1ABFKLMPSUX
)
.P
9vx is not so stable as native Plan9 systems.
